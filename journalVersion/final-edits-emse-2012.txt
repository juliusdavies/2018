Hi, Editor,

I improved a few paragraphs.  For now I've pasted
the raw latex.  If you can work with that, great,
but if not, let me know, and I will provide you
with those edits in a different way.

Also, I requested some changes to Figure 4
(a code listing) which will change its line numbering.
Can you do this?  Or should I mock up a dummy
latex file with the listing for you to copy & paste?

-----------------------------

Q1:  Title correct.  Subtitle correct, but needs to be fixed
     in metadata.

Q2 & Q3:  I will send this within 24 hours of this email

Q4:  All tables checked, and edits provided below.

Q5:  My detailed edits below remove the dummy citation
     and fix it properly.

Q6 & Q7:  They look great.  Thanks!

Q8:  I will send this within 24 hours of this email.


Q8 (line 1328):

*** Metadata ***

- Metadata pg. 1, line 2:
  Article Sub-Title is blank in Metadata.
  Should be:  "Determining the provenance of software development artifacts."


*** Article ***

- Article, line 17:
  "conduct" should be "conducted"

- Line 67, 68:
  Paragraph isn't fully justified.

- Line 127:
  "previous report" should be "initial report"

- Lines 231 - 242:
  Could these definitions be distanced from each other a
  little better?  (A little more space between them?)
  Also, dictionary-style indenting would be nice,
  with the defined term offset to the left a little.
  (If the formatting is on purpose to conform to
   J.EMSE's style, then so be it.)

- Line 256:
  "sometimes beta tags are removed from version identifiers"
  is pretty esoteric.  Change it to "some projects do not
  bother including version information in their releases"

- Line 257:
  Change "the library" to "library"  (remove "the")

- Line 258:
  Change "the application" to "a consuming application"

- Line 313:
  Change "tuple" to "3-tuple"

- Line 316:
  Change "tuple" to "4-tuple"

- Line 321:
  Change "Java file" to "Java class"

- Lines 329-339:
  Rewrite paragraph that begins "When building" to the following:

When building the signature, all fully qualified
object types in the decompiled bytecode
(including those in \mytt{throws} clauses)
are stripped of their package prefixes.
For example, \mytt{g.h.I} becomes \mytt{I}
and \mytt{java.lang.String} becomes \mytt{String}.
Java's \mytt{import} mechanism is effectively
irreproducible, since resolution of wildcard imports
(e.g., \mytt{import java.util.*})
depends on the exact contents of
directories and archive files listed in the
\mytt{CLASSPATH} environment variable at the time of
compilation.\footnote{Identifying
the class's \emph{own} fully qualitifed name is determinate.
The indeterminism only arises when we try to resolve internal
references that point to \emph{other} classes.}
To workaround this limitation we remove the namespace
component of every referenced object type.
Fully qualified names in source code
that are referenced inline --- although rare --- are also
stripped of their package prefixes, since we have no way
of knowing in the bytecode if the name came from an import
statement or from an inline type reference.


- Line 345:
  Change:  "of its method a(String)"
  To:      "of its one method."
  

- Lines 350-351:
  Change:  "as the set of signatures of its contained classes"
  To:      "as the set of class signatures generated from the $n$ classes."
  (Note:  $n$ means italicized n.  Don't add dollar-signs!)


- Figure 3 (listing):
  Remove the word "default"


- Rewrite first 6 paragraphs of section 4.5 (lines 376-400, including
  formula between lines 399 and 400) to the following 3 paragraphs:

Given a candidate archive, we can use the similarity,
inclusion, and containment indices to approximate the
extent to which archives in our corpus contain identical
code as the candidate, either in binary or source form.
The indices also help us understand the nature of the
provenance relationship.  \emph{Similarity} helps us when
the candidate is directly related to its match.
\emph{Containment} helps us when the candidate cloned some
of its dependencies (the candidate is a super-archive),
and \emph{inclusion} helps us for the inverse situation,
when the candidate is itself a cloned dependency,
and other super-archives include the candidate.
All three situations can arise simultaneously when
analyzing even a single candidate, since an archive can
clone its dependencies, can be cloned by others, and,
finally, can match relatives of itself.  Users of our
methods should prioritize one index over another depending
on their specific analytical needs.

\emph{Inclusion} and \emph{containment} are simple ratios
that report the percentage of common-code contained in the
candidate and the dependency, respectively, and thus they
are simple to interpret.  For example,
\mytt{Azureus2.jar} (from Vuze, version 4.3.0.6) scores
inclusion of 8.9\% and containment
of 32.5\% when compared to \mytt{bcprov-jdk14-138.jar}.
This tells us that Azureus can be seen as containing 32.5\%
of BouncyCastle (version 138), and, conversely, BouncyCastle
can be seen as containing 8.9\% of Azureus.  The causality of
the provenance is unknown --- Who copied from who?  Could
code be flowing in both directions? --- but the relationship
between these two artifacts is evident, and further manual
analysis can unearth the causality
(Azureus copied from BouncyCastle).

The \emph{similarity} measure is more complicated to
understand, since Jaccard is a ratio of set-intersection
to set-union, and  thus lacks a natural mapping to provenance,
except at the extreme values (1.0 is a perfect match,
0.0 occurs when nothing matches).
Since non-extreme similarity values contain little inherent
meaning, we interpet \emph{similarity} as an ordering function:  
higher scores imply better matches. 
Thus we can formalize finding the best match(es) for a binary
archive in an archive corpus using the similarity metric as
follows: given a set of archives $S = \{ s_1, ..., s_n\}$
(the corpus), we define the \emph{best candidate matches}
of subject archive $a$ as the subset of $L \subseteq S$ such that:

\[ \forall s_i \in L \quad sim(a,s_i) > 0 \wedge sim(a,s_i) = max_{sim}[S, a]  \]
where $max_{sim}[S, a]$ is the maximum similarity index of $a$ and the
elements in $S$.
