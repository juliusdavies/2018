The paragraph just after the formula,
starting "In the ideal case, L has only one member"
should be merged into previous paragraph.


- (Page 17)
Change "Similarity Index" to "similarity index" (lowercase) in two
places:

Change "Similarity Index" to "similarity index" (lowercase) in two
places:

- Table 1
Can we get a single thin horizontal line (like a cell border)
placed after the 5th row of data, to better separate the top-5
rows from the bottom-2 rows?


- Table 3
Bold the following four *complete rows*:
---
High quality matches 383
Low qualitiy matches 107
No matches 455
Total Matches:  (52%) 490  Average: 0.685  Average: 2.4
---

- Table 3:  change "Total Matches:" to "Total matches:" (lowercase the 'm')

- Table 9:  can we get a thin horizontal line (like a cell border)
placed just above the entire "bin2bin/Industry-81" row, as well

- Table 6, in the caption:
Change: "matched out subject's,"
To:     "matched our subject (jsearch-indexer-2.0.05.ds1.jar),"


- Table 12, row 8 or 9 I believe:
Change: "matches in 2011 case-study omitted"
To:     "matches in 2011 case-study omitted.  Only 8 of these 26 omitted matches scored 1.000 in the 2012 study."
(You may need to add an extra row and rework these three rows to look better, sorry!)


- Page 33:
Change: "large one Table 8."
To:     "large one (see Table 8 for an example of this)."


- Table 13 needs cardinality brackets in the column headers (sorry!):
Change column header "b" to "|b|"
Change column header "a INTERSECT b" to "|a INTERSECT b|"
Change "(with a = 469)" to "(with |a| = 469)" in the title.
(ps. by INTERSECT I mean the symbol \bigcap).



- FINAL REQUEST:
All of our captions are quite detailed, and most contain several sentences.
I like your style whereby captions do not end with periods; I think it helps
offset them from the general text.  But I don't think that style is working
for this paper since our captions tend to be long and detailed.

Can we have a final period added to all captions in the paper, including
all figures and tables?
