        ABSTRACT ={Software evolution and software quality are ever changing phenomena. As
software evolves, evolution impacts software quality. On the other hand,
software quality needs may drive software evolution strategies.

This  paper presents  an  approach to  schedule  quality improvement  under
constraints  and  priority.   The  general  problem  of  scheduling  quality
improvement has been instantiated into  the concrete problem of planning duplicated
code removal in a geographical information  system developed in C throughout the
last  20  years.  Priority  and  constraints  arise  from development  team
and from  the adopted development process. The  developer team long
term goal  is to  get rid of  duplicated code, improve  software structure,
decrease coupling, and improve cohesion.

We present our problem formulation, the adopted approach, including a model
of clone removal  effort and preliminary results obtained  on a real world
application.
