DEDICATION
\end{center}

\begin{center}
This work is dedicated to DMG because if
you take all people on Earth (minus myself
and DMG), and you count all the times they
will collectively read this document, counting
from now until the moment the Sun goes dark,
DMG will still have read the document more
times.
